# What is SmplLog?

It's a multi threaded logging tool, heavily inspired by Log4Net. Features like multiple loggers, with multiple
appenders, xml configuration are all there in a < 40k dll. 

Features I never used in Log4Net like ability to reformat appender output and a some of the extensibility endpoints
are not.

Usage should be apparent after perusing some of the unit tests (which were my first attempt, so are not by any means perfect).
